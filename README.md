# tumblr.js REPL

An interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for the [tumblr.js](https://www.github.com/tumblr/tumblr.js) that you can use to make calls to the Tumblr API.

## Installation

    npm install -g tumblr-repl

## Usage

You can enter the interactive console like this:

    $ tumblr

### Authentication

You'll need a credentials file that defines `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `token`, and `token_secret` in order to authenticate requests. You can specify the path to it directly:

    $ tumblr --credentials=path/to/credentials.json

Otherwise, it will look for `tumblr-credentials.json` or `credentials.json` in the current directory. Failing that, it will look for `tumblr-credentials.json` in your home directory.

### Client Methods

In the REPL console, the `tumblr` object holds the instance of the Tumblr client with the credentials you supplied. For convenience, we automatically supply a callback if you omit one, so you can do things like this:

    tumblr.js > tumblr.blogInfo('staff')

...and the response will print right before your eyes. What a time to be alive!

Type `help` to get a list of methods on the client.
